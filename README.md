✈️ Airline Ticket Booking System
📌 Overview
The Airline Ticket Booking System is a console-based application written in C++ that allows airline management to add and manage airlines and tickets. It also enables users to register, log in, and purchase tickets. All data is stored in files using the C++ file handling system—no database is used.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of file I/O, object-oriented programming, and user interaction via the console.
